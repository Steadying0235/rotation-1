- IMU/GPS spoofing of drones in software
- End-to-end system simulation (including as many components as possible)
- Choosing simulation software
- Expanding to other physical attack mechanisms than RF (laser, vision,
  acoustic)
- Experimenting with dynamic flight scenarios
- Experimenting with directional, focused MIMO antenna setup vs omnidirectional,
  singular antennae

- ROS + Gazebo + PX4/Ardupilot for RV simulation?
- Matlab simulink for wireless communications

- Can an IMU/GPS spoofing attack propagate to the takeover of a drone?
  - What about with other attack mechanisms?
