  abstract = {Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) using LiDAR-based object detection systems are rapidly improving and becoming an increasingly viable method of transportation. While effective at perceiving the surrounding environment, these detection systems are shown to be vulnerable to attacks using lasers which can cause obstacle misclassifications or removal. These laser attacks, however, are challenging to perform, requiring precise aiming and accuracy. Our research exposes a new threat in the form of Intentional Electro-Magnetic-Interference (IEMI), which affects the time-of-flight (TOF) circuits that make up modern LiDARs. We show that these vulnerabilities can be exploited to force the AV Perception system to misdetect, misclassify objects, and perceive non-existent obstacles. We evaluate the vulnerability in three AV perception modules (PointPillars, PointRCNN, and Apollo) and show how the classification rate drops below 50\%. We also analyze the impact of the IEMI injection on two fusion models (AVOD and Frustum-ConvNet) and in real-world scenarios. Finally, we discuss potential countermeasures and propose two strategies to detect signal injection.},

The systems utilize a just-in-time checkpoint protocol that stores volatile states when a power outage occurs, ensuring crash consistency. However, this paper uncovers a new security vulnerability in the checkpoint protocol, revealing its susceptibility to electromagnetic interference (EMI). If exploited, adversaries could cause denial of service or data corruption in victim devices. To defeat EMI attacks, this paper introduces GECKO, a compiler-directed countermeasure that operates on commodity platforms used in energy harvesting systems without requiring hardware support. Our experiments on real boards demonstrate that GECKO defeats the EMI attack with a trivial performance overhead by 6\% on average.},

  abstract = {Alleviating range anxiety for electric vehicles (i.e., whether such vehicles can be relied upon to travel long distances in a timely manner) is critical for sustainable transportation. Extremely fast charging (XFC), whereby electric vehicles (EV) can be quickly recharged in the time frame it takes to refuel an internal combustion engine, has been proposed to alleviate this concern. A critical component of these chargers is the efficient and proper operation of power converters that convert AC to DC power and otherwise regulate power delivery to vehicles. These converters rely on the integrity of sensor and actuation signals. In this work the operation of state-of-the art XFC converters is assessed in adversarial conditions, specifically against Intentional Electromagnetic Interference Attacks (IEMI). The targeted system is analyzed with the goal of determining possible weak points for IEMI, viz. voltage and current sensor outputs and gate control signals. This work demonstrates that, with relatively low power levels, an adversary is able to manipulate the voltage and current sensor outputs necessary to ensure the proper operation of the converters. Furthermore, in the first attack of its kind, it is shown that the gate signal that controls the converter switches can be manipulated, to catastrophic effect; i.e., it is possible for an attacker to control the switching state of individual transistors to cause irreparable damage to the converter and associated systems. Finally, a discussion of countermeasures for hardware designers to mitigate IEMI-based attacks is provided.},

  abstract = {Human-machine interactions (HMIs), e.g., touchscreens, are essential for users to interact with mobile devices. They are also beneficial in resisting emerging active attacks, which aim at maliciously controlling mobile devices, e.g., smartphones and tablets. With touchscreen-like HMIs, users can notice and interrupt malicious actions conducted by the attackers timely and perform necessary countermeasures, e.g., tapping the `Quit' button on the touchscreen. However, the effect of HMI-oriented active attacks has not been investigated yet. In this paper, we present a practical attack towards touch-based devices, namely Expelliarmus. It reveals a new attack surface of active attacks for hijacking users' operations and thus taking full control over victim devices. Expelliarmus neutralizes users' touch commands by producing a reverse current via electromagnetic interference (EMI). Since the reverse current offsets the current change caused by a touch, the touchscreen detects no current change and thus ignores users' commands. Besides this basic denial-of-service attack, we also realize a target cancellation attack, which can neutralize target commands, e.g., `Quit' without interference in irrelevant operations. Thus, the active attack can be completely performed without interruption from users, even if they are alerted by the abnormal events. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of Expelliarmus on 29 off-the-shelf devices.},

If it reports incorrect data, the drones cannot maintain their attitude and will consequently crash down to the ground. Therefore, several anti-drone studies have focused on causing the significant fluctuations in the IMU sensor data by resonating the mechanical structure of the internal sensors using a crafted acoustic wave. However, this approach is limited in terms of efficacy for several reasons. As the structural details of each sensor in an IMU significantly differ by type, model, and manufacturer, the attack needs to be conducted independently for each sensor. Furthermore, it can be easily mitigated by using other supplementary sensors that are not corrupted by the attack or inexpensive plastic shielding.},

Yet, we discover that attackers can overcome the challenges by fulfilling specific prerequisites and finely tuning attack parameters.

Analog sensing of signals on the order of a few millivolts is particularly sensitive to interference. This work (1) measures the susceptibility of analog sensor systems to signal injection attacks by intentional, low-power emission of chosen electromagnetic waveforms, and (2) proposes defense mechanisms to reduce the risks. Our experiments use specially crafted EMI at varying power and distance to measure susceptibility of sensors in implantable medical devices and consumer electronics. Results show that at distances of 1-2m, consumer electronic devices containing microphones are vulnerable to the injection of bogus audio signals. Our measurements show that in free air, intentional EMI under 10 W can inhibit pacing and induce defibrillation shocks at distances up to 1-2m on implantable cardiac electronic devices. However, with the sensing leads and medical devices immersed in a saline bath to better approximate the human body, the same experiment decreases to about 5 cm. Our defenses range from prevention with simple analog shielding to detection with a signal contamination metric based on the root mean square of waveform amplitudes. Our contribution to securing cardiac devices includes a novel defense mechanism that probes for forged pacing pulses inconsistent with the refractory period of cardiac tissue.},

The vulnerability of the sensors appears to be influenced by the sensing technology and the geometry. The study also identifies a correlation between the electromagnetic field generated and the indicated temperature of the sensors. Furthermore, the study evaluates the vulnerability of the sensors to pulsed signals, identifying parameters that cause more errors than others and some patterns are identified.

  abstract = {Sensing data integrity in a cyber-physical system (CPS) is critical to its safe operation. Intolerable data manipulation can potentially lead to very hazardous consequences. Numerous countermeasures have proven capable of protecting sensitive circuitry, cabling, and their signals from the effects of electromagnetic interference (EMI). However, in the case of intentional electromagnetic interference (IEMI), existing countermeasures possess limited efficacy. IEMIcapable adversaries attack the signal processing circuits and signal paths between sensors/actuators and the controller, seeking to manipulate the signals and falsify data. On a printed circuit board (PCB), the traces carrying these signals act as unintentional receiving antennae to a time-varying electromagnetic field generated by an adversary. In this paper, we demonstrate IEMI attacks on the PCBs used in electric vehicle (EV) charging systems, a highly safety-critical CPS. To mitigate these attacks, we implement passive PCB-level countermeasures, namely, differential signaling, via-fencing, and optical fiber for interconnects. In addition, we propose and implement a multiplexer-based defense that dynamically modifies the route path and evades the adversary. All four countermeasures have been extensively evaluated against multiple adversarial setups and ranked based on their impact. Further, adaptive attacker strategies have been proposed to circumvent the effective countermeasures.},

This work aims to understand the feasibility and requirements of fully controlling a UAV's movements by spoofing GPS signals alone. We enumerate the challenges in accomplishing a complete UAV takeover through GPS spoofing and controlling it without crashing. We design and implement a Real-time GPS Signal Generator (RtGSG) that can be configured to generate any arbitrary trajectory and is capable of making changes to GPS signals in real-time through user input, e.g., using a keyboard or joystick. We evaluate RtGSG on popular commercial UAVs from DJI and Autel through over-the-air spoofing experiments in a controlled chamber. We explore generic and UAV-specific GPS spoofing strategies in order to best achieve complete maneuvering control (e.g., velocity and direction). This work highlights that, although COTS UAVs remain vulnerable to GPS spoofing attacks, a complete takeover and control of the UAV requires careful manipulation of the spoofing signals in real-time. Finally, we release our implementation to the scientific community for further research.},

Previous academic work has shown that many types of sensors are vulnerable to Intentional Electromagnetic Interference (IEMI) attacks, and it has been speculated that power converters are also susceptible.In this paper, we present the first detailed and practical evaluation of IEMI attacks against switched-mode power converters as a whole by manipulating the voltage and current sensors in their feedback loops. We develop a novel multi-frequency IEMI attack technique to effectively target devices with multiple sensors. We experimentally validate our theoretical predictions by analyzing multiple AC-DC and DC-DC converters, automotive-grade current sensors, dedicated battery chargers, and a real-world electric vehicle charger. Our attack is reliably effective at overcharging and permanently damaging Li-ion cells, and causing the EV charger to output 50 V more than it reports.},

However, despite growing research on physical attacks on sensors, our understanding of sensor hardware vulnerabilities remains fragmented due to the ad-hoc nature of this field. Moreover, the infinite attack signal space further complicates threat abstraction and defense. To address this gap, we propose a systematization framework, termed sensor out-of-band (OOB) vulnerabilities, that for the first time provides a comprehensive abstraction for sensor attack surfaces based on underlying physical principles. We adopt a bottom-up systematization methodology that analyzes OOB vulnerabilities across three levels. At the component level, we identify the physical principles and limitations that contribute to OOB vulnerabilities. At the sensor level, we categorize known attacks and evaluate their practicality. At the system level, we analyze how CPS features such as sensor fusion, closed-loop control, and intelligent perception impact the exposure and mitigation of OOB threats. Our findings offer a foundational understanding of sensor hardware security and provide guidance and future directions for sensor designers, security researchers, and system developers aiming to build more secure sensors and CPS.},

Although a wealth of research works have presented various attacks, some key questions remain unanswered: are these existing works complete enough to cover all the sensor spoofing threats? If not, how many attacks are not explored, and how difficult is it to realize them?This paper answers the above questions by comprehensively systematizing the knowledge of sensor spoofing attacks against RVs. Our contributions are threefold. (1) We identify seven common attack paths in an RV system pipeline. We categorize and assess existing spoofing attacks from the perspectives of spoofer property, operation, victim characteristic and attack goal. Based on this systematization, we identify 4 interesting insights about spoofing attack designs. (2) We propose a novel action flow model to systematically describe robotic function executions and unexplored sensor spoofing threats. With this model, we successfully discover 103 spoofing attack vectors, 26 of which have been verified by prior works, while 77 attacks are never considered. (3) We design two novel attack methodologies to verify the feasibility of newly discovered spoofing attack vectors.},

  abstract = {Due to the booming of autonomous driving, in which LiDAR plays a critical role in the task of environment perception, its reliability issues have drawn much attention recently. LiDARs usually utilize deep neural models for 3D point cloud perception, which have been demonstrated to be vulnerable to imperceptible adversarial examples. However, prior work usually manipulates point clouds in the digital world without considering the physical working principle of the actual LiDAR. As a result, the generated adversarial point clouds may be realizable and effective in simulation but cannot be perceived by physical LiDARs. In this work, we introduce the physical principle of LiDARs and propose a new method for generating 3D adversarial point clouds in accord with it that can achieve two types of spoofing attacks: object hiding and object creating. We also evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method with two 3D object detectors on the KITTI vision benchmark.},

  abstract = {Over the last six years, several papers demonstrated how intentional analog interference based on acoustics, RF, lasers, and other physical modalities could induce faults, influence, or even control the output of sensors. Damage to the availability and integrity of sensor output carries significant risks to safety-critical systems that make automated decisions based on trusted sensor measurement. Established signal processing models use transfer functions to express reliability and dependability characteristics of sensors, but existing models do not provide a deliberate way to express and capture security properties meaningfully.},

  abstract = {Sensor systems are used every time a microcontroller needs to interact with the physical world. They are abundant in home automation, factory control systems, critical infrastructure, transport systems and many, many other things. In a sensor system, a sensor transforms a physical quantity into an analog signal which is sent to an ADC and a microcontroller for digitization and further processing. Once the measurement is in digital form, the microcontroller can execute tasks according to the measurement. Electromagnetic interference (EMI) can affect a measurement as it is transferred to the microcontroller. An attacker can manipulate the sensor output by intentionally inducing EMI in the wire between the sensor and the microcontroller. The nature of the analog channel between the sensor and the microcontroller means that the microcontroller cannot authenticate whether the measurement is from the sensor or the attacker. If the microcontroller includes incorrect measurements in its control decisions, it could have disastrous consequences.},
