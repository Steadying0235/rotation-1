Steven has provided a good survey for the EMI attack but I do not think
developing an attack platform is sufficient for a paper.The literature on
existing works is okay. However, I do hope to see a more systematic
categorization of the IEMI attacks. For example, in each of the existing works,
what attack surface was utilized, and what approach was used? From the current
write-up, I can only know it is an IEMI attack. I can't see the limitation of
the previous works. For example, rather than assuming ideal conditions, what
would you propose for the environment to conduct the attacks? Then, these
assumptions are also not considered in the proposed method. As a result, I don't
see the novelty of the proposed end-to-end attack platform. Several works have
already emulated IEMI attacks in HITL or SITL. What does your work differ from
previous works?

The insights drawn from the survey are clearly organized, synthesizing them and
formulate the future work more concrete would be better; in terms of
feasibility, giving out some numbers from the experimental results of the
existing works can be more persuasive.1. I think the writeup clearly maps out
the current state-of-the-art and limitations of prior work. If this testbed is
successfully develop, perhaps a second contribution wcould be a measurement
study of the performance of prior works using the proposed testbed. 2. I think
the next step might be to find out what standard metrics or bemchmarks are
typically used to evaluate IEMI attacks in the community.

My synthesis

- developing an attack platform is insufficient for a paper
- think about attack surfaces utilized in demonstrated attacks
- focus heavier on limitations of existing works
